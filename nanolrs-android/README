Basic Usage:

Set to use the Android Persistence Manager in onCreate
before running any database operation (not a problem if this is
called repeatedly):

PersistenceManager.setPersistenceManagerFactory(new PersistenceManagerFactoryAndroid());

To add extra tables to the database:

((PersistenceManagerAndroid)PersistenceManager.getInstance()).addDatabaseCreateOrUpdateListener

Implement onCreate and onUpgrade methods
